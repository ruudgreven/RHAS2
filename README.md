# RHAS 2
RHAS 2 is the successor of RHAS. It is much more flexible and has a more modular structure

## Backend
The backend is the part that doesn't do UI stuff, it consists of scripts and configuration used by the frontend or used by cronjobs or other services that use RHAS 2.

### RHASI
The backend contains the Ruud's Home Automation Script Interpreter which can be used to read XML files that specifies certain actions that the Home Automation System should perform
